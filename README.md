# 2021-NBA-Big-Board-Picker
This here is an HTML program that allows you create a big board of the 2021 NBA Draft propects. As you might be able to see this based off of the [Favorite Pokemon Picker](https://www.dragonflycave.com/favorite.html). So I'm not a programmer so this whole thing is pretty barebones and while I'd like to add more, I've reach my technical limit for just a small side project. I'll leave a list of things I want to add at the bottom and I'll see what I can come back and complete later.

**How To Use**

- Download the zip by using the green dropdown menu
- Extract the folder included
- Run the html file on a web browser of your choice
